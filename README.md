This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## `React Hooks Intro`

This repo contains a simple lesson about React.js hooks. It is only a intro, allowing you to see how Hooks could be implemented on your code with ease. I'm following the React docs, but putting a little twist on the full App.

## Running

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

#### `Uses react-router-dom for demonstration purposes`
